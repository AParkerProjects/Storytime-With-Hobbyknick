Clad in my Lederhose, wielding a brat. Dressed for the occasion now,
wettewerbsfaehig and hot!

In the midst of the commotion, I stumbled into a Biergarten,
only to be greeted by a friendly Hund balancing a pretzel on its nose,
like it was the main event at a Baeckerei talent show.

Hansel and Gretel went to Hauptstrasse and ate Doener.

Down Hauptstrasse, we bumped into old Mr. Mehlhase, who wouldn’t let 
us pass without trying his Apfelkuchen. With Apfelkuchen in hand, we 
ducked into a Biergarten as a band kicked off the night with ‘Du Hast’ 
by Rammstein.

The sound of metal fills the air. It rips, it tears, like chaotic software.
The circle was forming, a human typhoon, wettewerbsfaehig! A mosh pit too 
soon! Confused, disoriented, I'll embrace the metal, while Hansel duels 
Gretel with a Gebaeck filled kettle.

Because my Lederhose was bulging from all the Bratwurst, Doener and 
Apfelkuchen I had a difficult time squeezing behind the wheel of my 
Porsche. Fortunately I had not indulged in the Biergarten yet as a I 
had to take evasive actions to avoid a crazy wettbewerbsfaehig BMW driver 
fly by me. Because of this close call I needed to blast the calm peaceful 
music from Rammstein to ease my nerves.

On our road trip from Berlin to Raesfeld, we stopped at a small Bäckerei on the Hauptstrasse to buy some freshly baked Brot and Gebäck before heading to Schloss Raesfeld; later, we enjoyed a lunch of Bratwurst and Döner in a Biergarten, where we watched a Porsche and BMW race past, all while a Rammstein song played in the background and a Hund in Lederhose and Dirndl danced around.
